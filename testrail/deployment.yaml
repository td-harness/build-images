# This YAML exposes the fields defined in the UI. It can be edited directly or have new YAML pasted in.
# Not all available Kubernetes properties are recognized by the form exposed in the UI, and unrecognized properties are ignored during import.
# If the required properties are not supported by this step, the 'Deploy raw Kubernetes YAML' step can be used to deploy YAML directly to Kubernetes, and supports all properties.
